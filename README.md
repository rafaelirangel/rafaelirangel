 <summary> About me üë©üèª‚Äçüíª </summary>
I am a girl who has always been deeply passionate about technology. My journey began when I took it upon myself to learn IT skills independently. Eventually, I was fortunate enough to secure a job that allowed me to enhance my existing skills and acquire new ones. After a couple of years, I yearned for a fresh challenge, which led me to move to the USA to immerse myself in the language and experience the vibrant culture. It was during my time here that I discovered numerous opportunities in the field of Software Engineering. I thought to myself, "Why not?" and embraced this exciting path. Determined to take on this new challenge, I started building a strong foundation on my own, and now I have successfully graduated from a SWE bootcamp. Coding has become my newfound passion, and I find myself joyfully engrossed in front of my computer for hours, creating and developing innovative projects. I am eagerly looking forward to showcasing my abilities and all that I can accomplish.
